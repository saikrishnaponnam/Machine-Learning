# Probability

**Sample Space:** entire set of possibilities for an experiment.   
**Event:** subset of the sample space.  
**Probability Distribution:** describes how probabilities are assigned to events.


$$ Var(X) = \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X])^2] \\
Var(X) = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\mathbb{E}[X])^2 $$

If X & Y are independent random variables, then:

$$
Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) \\
Var(XY) = Var(X)Var(Y) + E[X]^2Var(Y) + E[Y]^2Var(X)
$$

## Discrete distributions


## Continuous distributions



### Central Limit Theorem
Given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, provided the population has a finite mean and variance.
